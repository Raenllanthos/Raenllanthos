- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raenllanthos
- 👀 I’m interested in ............... games, music, programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .......... programming, music, and making games!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any of the 3 above!
I play Valheim, Age of Empires 2, and World of Warcraft Classic (albeit on a private server, much better people there). I am learning and enjoying playing guitar
and bass and I hope to make some music sometime also :)
